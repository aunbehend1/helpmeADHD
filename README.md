# Help Me with ADHD


# Project Overview 
Help Me with ADHD is an app to help someone with ADHD get better control of their time. The application does this with three different methods. The timer function can help by breaking a task into chunks and allowing the user to take breaks when trying to finish. A tasks tracker, that list all current tasks a user is working on with a due date for each. Finally a reporting function. Reports help a user determine how often they are completing tasks by the due date and the amount of tasks that are being completed.
